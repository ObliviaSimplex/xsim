# Test 1: Each CPU prints its own letter.
# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This test has each active CPU print out a letter between A and Z, depending
on its ID. No more than 26 CPUs should be employed for this task, for obvious
reasons.

The expected output is an interleaved series of letters. Both my implementation
and the gold implementation succeed in doing this.

Compile with:

../xas test.1.xas test.1.xo

Run with:

./xmpsim 10000 test.1.xo 0 26
