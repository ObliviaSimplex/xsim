# Test 2: Print "HELLO". Each CPU with ID < 7 prints one letter. 
# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This test performs a simplified version of the kernel's wait_for_init
routine, by having each CPU wait for its own turn to print a character,
and spin in circles until its turn comes. CPUs with ID over 6 will not
be given a turn at all.

When it is the active CPU's turn, it prints letters[i], where i is the
number returned by cpuid.

The output is

HELLO

terminated by a new line.
