# xsim
A rudimentary CPU emulator, written in C.

This is just an assignment for a course I'm taking in operating systems,
so there's nothing terribly exciting or novel here. Not all of this
code is mine -- some of it is boilerplate that came with the assignment,
some of it consists of examples and tests meant to be run on the CPU
we build.

What is mine is as follows:
- 98% of the code in xcpu.c (including the pretty debugger, which has been
a lifesaver in helping me find my typo-prone ways through the arcana of the
emulator),
- xsim.c,
- memcpy in stdio.xas and its tests,
- probably a bunch of other bits and pieces, too, and more to come.

If you're taking a similar course, well, don't plagiarize a git repo.
You'll never fool anyone.
