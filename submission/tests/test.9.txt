# Test 9: Palindrome Checker
# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This test runs through some more basic input/output functionality, 
stack operations, and arithmetical comparisons. It employs a new
implementation of strlen() in stdout, and uses this in another
function that determines whether or not a given string is a palin-
drome.

The palindrome-checker, palcheck(), returns a 1 if the string is
a palindrome, and 0 if the string is not one.

Both xsim and xsim_gold produce the same output when executing
this test (whether or not the debug bit is set).

I have left the std instruction commented out, since this test
makes a fair bit of use of stdout, but it can easily be uncommented
and recompiled.
