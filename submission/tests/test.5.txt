Test 5: stdout instructions
        cld, std, and out
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This test walks through a few output-related instructions. One surprising
bug that was found is that I had completely forgotten to put an entry for
cld into my jump table in xcpu.c! It just hadn't come up until now. This
was easily fixed.

Apart from that, the program behaved as expected, printing a jumble of
std information, interspersed with the messages

hi, how are you today?
fine

The output of ./xsim perfectly matched that of ./xsim_gold, and can be
found in test.5.out.
