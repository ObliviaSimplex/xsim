Test 6: Function Calls
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This test experiments with the instructions most relevant to function calls:

call     ret     callr    push     pop    loadi    load

among a few others. Functions are called directly, with call, by pointers
stored in registers with callr, with and without parameters, and recursively.

In all cases, the output matched xsim_gold's, without a hitch. No new bugs
were discovered.
