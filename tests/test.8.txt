A friend has told me that he discovered a bug with his implementation of load,
whereby attempts to load from the memory pointed to by a register into that
same register has resulted in some anomalies, which don't match up with the
output of xsim_gold. I decided that this would be a good thing to test, to see
if my own implementation falls victim to the same bug.

This test performs a handful of simple operations that take the same register
for both rS and rD. I'm happy to say that my implementation does not suffer from
the same bugs.

No new bugs were discovered.
