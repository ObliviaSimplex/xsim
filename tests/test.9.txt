TEST 9: CAESAR CIPHER
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The instructions tested by this test include:

push     pop     call     loadi
load     loadb   storb    mov
neg      xor     out      add
cmp      br      jr
 
It takes the string "Hello, world!" and encrypts it using a simple rot3
Caesar cipher, performed in an external function called "caesar" in the
shared object file caesar.xo (source in caesar.xas). The Caesar function
is, in its essentials, the same as memcpy, with the small addition that
it transforms the bytes that it copies by adding an integer less than
256 (the maximum value of a byte) to them. This is complex enough to put
call and ret, and the stack-manipulation instructions to the test, as
well as the arithmetic instruction add.

Because this test makes a fair bit of use of stdout, I have left the
debug bit off for this one (as well as the next).
